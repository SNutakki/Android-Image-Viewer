  <h3>Image Crawler Fork-Join Pool App (Assignment 4a)</h3>

  <p>The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your experience using
    Java 8 functional programming features and their integration with
    the Java fork-join pool.  In particular, in this assignment you'll
    develop an app that uses the Java 8 fork-join framework to obtain,
    store, and transform images.</p>

  <p> As before, the code you'll write for this assignment will have
    GUI and will run as an app. Please use this GUI to help debug your
    solution. </p>

  <h4>Getting Started</h4>

  <hr width=50% align=left>
  <h4>Overview of the Assignment 4a</h4>

  <p> In this part of the assignment you'll complete the
  implementation of an image crawler class in the
  <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/ForkJoinCrawler.java</CODE>
  file that obtains, stores, and transforms images.  This class uses
  Java fork-join pool framework to perform an "image crawl" starting
  from a root Uri.  Depending on the parameters used to run the tests,
  images from HTML page reachable from the root Uri are either
  downloaded from a remote web server or read from the local file
  system and the results are stored in files. </p>

  <p>The bulk of the code for the app is provided in the skeletons.
    In fact, a complete solution using Java 7 features provided in the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/crawlers/SequentialLoopsCrawler.java</CODE>
    file.  Your will therefore focus on converting this Java 7-based
    class to the <CODE>ForkJoinCrawler</CODE> class that uses the Java
    fork-join pool. </p>

    <p> Everyone taking the course (i.e., both ugrads and grads) must
    also include your completed implementations of all the methods in
    the
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/ArrayCollector.java</CODE>
    and
    <CODE>image-crawler/src/main/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler/utils/Array.java</CODE>
    files. Make sure that these classes work properly or you'll lose points. </p> 

  </ul>

  <p> Your solution can either use conventional for Java 7 for-loop
    loops or Java 8 lambda expressions and method references, as you see fit. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for this assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS891/tree/master/assignments/assignment4a/">here</a>
    in my GitHub account.  Now that you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

  <p> JUnit unit tests in the
  <code>image-crawler/src/test/java/edu/vanderbilt/imagecrawler</code>
  folder are provided to increase our confidence that your
  implementation is working as expected.  You can run all the unit
  tests by right-clicking on 'AllTests' in this folder. </p>

  <p> If you need help learning how to use the Android Studio GUI to
  run the JUnit test locally on your computer please see <A
  HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
  and/or ask questions.  As usual, testing only demonstrates the
  presence of bugs, not their absence, so don't rely solely on the
  JUnit tests to detect problems in your code. </p>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Additional Resources</h4>

  <p> The following resources may be helpful in completing this
    assignment: </p>

  <ul> 

  <li>Videos that give a detailed overview of the Java fork-join pool
    framework is available in Week 11 of my <A
    HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs891/">CS 891 class
    website</A>.  <p>

  <li>Good overviews of the Java fork-join pool appear <A
  HREF="https://www.infoq.com/interviews/doug-lea-fork-join">here</A>
  and <A
  HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/fork-join-422606.html">here</A>.
</li>
</ul>

  <hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4> <p>

    <p> The fork-join pool framework in Assignment 4a is more tedious
    than the previous assignments that used Java 8 parallel streams
    since you have to do more of the work manually.  Therefore, please
    start the assignment soon and ask questions in class, office
    hours, and on the discussion forums.  As usual, the app, image
    crawler skeletons, and JUnit tests are extensive, though you don't
    need to understand them all to complete your solution. </p>
